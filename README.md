# Wordle
This repository is intended to highlight one of my first computer science projects with Jed Rembold in CS151. The project is a creation of the popular New York Times game Wordle. 
<h2>Instructions</h2>
You have six attempts to guess the five letter word randomly chosen from a word dictionary. Use either your keyboard or the onscreen keyboard and mouse to type the word out. After typing the word, hit enter, the color of the tiles will change. If the color of the tile is green, the letter is in the correct spot. If the tile is yellow, the letter is in the word but in the incorrect spot. If the tile is grey, that letter isn't in the word.
